rtl8812au
=========
Raspberry Pi Friendly (Raspbian)
Linux kernel driver for USB WiFi dongles based on Realtek rtl8812au chipset.

This is a fork of gordboy/rtl8812au, which is based on 5.2.9 realtek driver
version, obtained from ftp3.realtek.com.tw, as described here:

- https://github.com/astsam/rtl8812au/issues/51#issuecomment-315117972

It has a few patches on top of it to make it work in 802.11ac (VHT) mode (at
least with hostapd), remove hardcoded regulatory restrictions, print more debug
info by default (can be disabled via module parameters) and override default
txpower values (via rtw_tx_pwr_idx_override module option, see modinfo), plus a
few other misc ad-hoc tweaks.

Afaik 5.2.9 wasn't tested as extensively as older rtl8812au version
(e.g. 5.1.5), but seem to have straightforward improvements and patches,
so what can possibly go wrong? :)

(see "old-5.1.5" branch here for when it does)

Also, it's configured by default to build on ODROID-C2 (arm64/aarch64) platform,
not x86, but can be easily reconfigured to build there too by e.g. running this
sed line::

  sed -i \
    -e 's:^\(CONFIG_PLATFORM_.*= *\).*:\1n:' \
    -e 's:^\(CONFIG_PLATFORM_I386_PC *= *\).*:\1y:' Makefile

(or alternatively running ``patch -l -i Makefile.x86.patch``, does same thing)

For ArchLinuxARM PKGBUILD of module from this repo for ODROID-C2 (aarch64,
mainline 4.13.x+ kernel), see:

Note on support / development / patches
---------------------------------------

I'm not supporting or developing this driver here, just collected a bunch of
ad-hoc patches from different sources for my own purposes.

Please do not ask me to add or merge additional featues or fix something here -
I'm not a kernel developer and don't even have hardware to test this locally.

Maybe just fork the repo and apply whatever you need there instead, or complain
about anything that doesn't work right to hardware vendor or realtek (though
note that they haven't released this code publicly - see source links at the top
of this README).


Performance
-----------

**Important:** these test results are for previous 5.1.5 driver version with
same VHT patches, results on 5.2.9 (codebase here) may vary!

Should very heavily depend on card/dongle used, but with ALFA Network AWUS036AC
USB dongles plugged into RPi3/ODROID-C2 that I've tested using WiFi
Infrastructure mode (AP + STA) over VHT (802.11ac) with 80MHz channels (in 5GHz
band) and TX-STBC-2BY1/RX-STBC-1 MIMO parameters, throughput limit seem to be
about 220mbps or ~26 MiB/s (half-duplex).

I.e. something that looks like this::

Again, these results are for one specific pair of AP/STA dongles, running in a
specific environment and configuration, so does not mean that other devices
supported by this driver will have same limitations, and are here just to show
that driver itself can at least support that much throughput (easily - extra cpu
load is negligible).

Relevant hostapd.conf options used for this specific dongle and test::

  hw_mode=a
  ieee80211n=1
  require_ht=1
  ieee80211ac=1
  require_vht=1

  channel=149
  vht_oper_chwidth=1
  vht_oper_centr_freq_seg0_idx=155
  ht_capab=[HT40+][SHORT-GI-40]
  vht_capab=[SHORT-GI-80][TX-STBC-2BY1][MAX-MPDU-11454][MAX-A-MPDU-LEN-EXP7][RX-STBC-1]

Same as for test results, these aren't necessarily supported by all dongles,
and some dongles might allow e.g. 160MHz or 80+80 channel widths (different
vht_oper_chwidth values), 2x2 or 4x4 STBC, beamforming, and such, which driver
seem to have the code for.

For more information about what your specific dongle supports and is configured
for, use /proc interface that this driver provides under ``/proc/net/rtl8812au/``.

Some useful info nodes there (replace "wlan0" below with your interface name):

- ``/proc/net/rtl8812au/ver_info`` - loaded driver version.

- ``/proc/net/rtl8812au/drv_cfg`` - build-time driver configuration info.

- ``/proc/net/rtl8812au/log_level`` - kmsg (dmesg) logging control.

- ``/proc/net/rtl8812au/wlan0/phy_cap`` - phy capabilities (VHT, STBC,
  Beamforming, etc), as supported by hardware/driver and configuration,
  including resulting mask of them.

- ``/proc/net/rtl8812au/wlan0/ap_info`` (and ``sta_info``).

- ... and many more, in addition to rather extensive logging that is enabled by default.
